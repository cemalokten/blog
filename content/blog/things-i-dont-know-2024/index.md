title: Things I Don't Know - 2024 Edition

On the constant journey of learning to become a better programmer, here is a list of things I would like to at least try and hopefully even use in a project this year, along with some questions I'd like to answer and some personal goals.

1. __Data structures and algorithms__: Figure out why some things are fast and some are slow. For example, why does finding an index in an array take longer than retrieving a value from an object?

2. __Database migrations__: What happens when I need to change the schema? How can I migrate existing data without ruining my life? - [Dev Deletes Entire Production Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLdRBsuvVKc) ðŸ‘€ 

3. __Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)__: I live in constant fear of deployment, with a general approach that amounts to 'future me will figure it out'. It would be nice to feel on top of it.

4. __What are WebSockets?__ How can I use one/them in a project?

5. __JSDoc__: What is it? Why use it instead of Typescript?

6. __Test-Driven Development (TDD)__: This ones been on my list for a while.

7. __Linux core utils__: I love the command line but have often avoided using things like AWK, SED, and FD.

8. __Read the documentation__: I tend to jump in before having a clue.

9. __Get something I've built into the hands of a real user__ - someone I've never met who decides to use what I've created simply because it solves a problem they have. This feels doable but also impossible at the same time.

10. __Read one of the books on my shelf__, unlikely, but I can dream.
