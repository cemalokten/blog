title: Bobbe Update - Ready to test

It's been a few months since I last shared an update on Bobbe, my project aimed at simplifying the process of finding a therapist. I thought it would be a pretty straightforward problem to solve, but it turns out that creating a site that helps someone make informed decisions about which therapists to talk to is way more complex than I imagined.


## The Goal: Removing barriers and jargon
My goal was to get rid of the obstacles and confusing jargon often associated with searching for a therapist. 

I wanted to create a platform where therapists could showcase their unique personalities and expertise without overwhelming potential clients with excessive information. When someone visits Bobbe, they should be able to quickly get a sense of a therapist's personality, experience, and typical cost per session. At the same time, the site should be easy for therapists to use. On top of all this, I wanted the site to appeal to a younger crowd with a modern, warm, and inviting design. ðŸ˜Š

## Your feedback
I would love your feedback on Bobbe. Feel free to sign up and create a profile. Your feedback is super important and really appreciated.

You can explore the site â†’  [bobbe.fly.dev](https://bobbe.fly.dev/)

If you're able to provide some quick feedback (3 - 5 minutes), here are the Google Forms:

â†’ [Users Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/SAgeerGSP6sUfWRz7)

â†’ [Therapists Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/Cx2CHdU8ugf1jTpb7)

The next steps involve gathering feedback, making necessary changes, bug fixing and then opening Bobbe up to the world!

P.S. - If you happen to know any therapists or are a therapist yourself who might be interested in a platform like Bobbe, I would love to hear from you!
