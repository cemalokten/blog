title: Creating a jargon free therapy directory
date: 2024-03-12

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on. It's called Bobbe, and it's all about making the process of finding a therapist simpler and more welcoming.

It all started when a few friends mentioned their struggles with finding a therapist. After some research I realised that existing directories, while comprehensive, can be overwhelming and complex, especially when you're not feeling great.

From personal experience, the right therapist can change your life. I wanted other people to have that experience.

So, with some time on my hands from being in-between jobs, I decided to embark on creating a simple, friendly, and jargon-free directory where anyone can find their perfect therapist.

### My aims for Bobbe:

- Make the search process smooth as possible
- Create a friendly and inviting environment
- Cut the big confusing words and keep things straightforward
- Privacy as a priority for therapy seekers, no cookies, no tracking
- Focus on essentials rather than overwhelming users with every type of therapy under the sun
- Generous free trial and referral program for therapists
- Create a place where trainee therapists can grow their practice
- Listen to feedback and build the most requested features

### Personal goals:

- Level up my coding skills in UI/UX, front-end, back-end, and DevOps
- Build a project that will help me stand-out to potential employers
- Create something that might make a difference in someone's life

## The Journey So Far ðŸš€

I'm excited to share what I've accomplished so far:

- Designed a warm, friendly interface with pastel colours and abstract shapes
- Created separate experiences for therapists and therapy seekers, prioritising privacy for therapy seekers
- Designed for mobile-first but ensured cross-device compatibility
- Gathered early feedback from friends to refine the user experience

## What's Next ðŸ”®

Over the next month, I'll be focusing on building out the back end, aiming to launch a working MVP by the end of this month. I'll be sharing my progress, wins, and challenges.

If you're curious to see how Bobbe is shaping up, feel free to have a look at the work-in-progress front end [here](https://bobbe.fly.dev/)! Keep in mind that it's still a work in progress.

If you have any thoughts, feedback, or just want to chat, don't hesitate to get in touch!

## The Joys of Building from Scratch

You might be wondering why I didn't just take the easy route and use a pre-built template. Building Bobbe from scratch has been a great learning opportunity. It has allowed me to give the platform its own unique personality while gaining invaluable experience in UX/UI and front-end development.

## Why is it called Bobbe?

My dog Bobby has been a great companion over the last few years and got me through some tough times, so Bobbe is named after Bobby. My hope is that Bobbe can be a similar companion to those seeking a therapist.

## The Tech Stack

- Remix for developer experience, simple design pattern, ability to fetch data directly in the component, and improved SEO

### Front-end
- Tailwind CSS combined with CVA for styling (so good!!)
- ShadUI for solid accessible components which I customised

### Backend and database
- Zod for form validation
- Supabase or Pocketbase to manage DB/Auth (undecided)
- Faker.js for populating the database with sensible dummy data
