It's been a while since I last shared an update on Bobbe, my project to make finding a therapist simpler. At first, I thought it would be a pretty straightforward problem to solve, but it turns out that creating a site that helps someone make informed decisions about which therapists to talk to is waaay more complex than I imagined. 

## Goals: Making therapy accessible and understandable
When I started working on Bobbe, my main goal was to make the process of finding a therapist easier and less confusing for everyone.

I wanted Bobbe to be user-friendly, focusing on what really matters without overwhelming people with too much information. I also wanted to use simple, everyday language that anyone could understand. With this latest update, I believe I've made a lot of progress towards these goals.

For therapists, Bobbe offers a platform to showcase their unique skills and personality in a clear and modern format. Signing up and managing their profile is designed to be straightforward and hassle-free.

People searching for a therapist can quickly get a feel for each therapist's background, experience, and fees. They can easily search for therapists based on their specific needs, save profiles they like, and reach out to therapists they want to learn more about.

## Your feedback
I feel like it's time to show the world, and I would love your feedback. Feel free to explore the site, sign up, and create a profile. Your feedback is super important and really appreciated. 

You can explore the site ‚Üí  [bobbe.fly.dev](https://bobbe.fly.dev/)

If you're able to provide some quick feedback (3 - 5 minutes), here are the feedback forms:

‚Üí [General feedback](https://lnkd.in/ezSiyteJ)

‚Üí [Therapists feedback](https://lnkd.in/e4gDzrDR)

The next steps involve gathering feedback, making necessary changes, bug fixing and then opening Bobbe up to the world!
