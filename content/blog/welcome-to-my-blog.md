This is probably my 5th attempt at trying to get a site up and running, it's only taken me about 6 months, and here it is in all its glory. I think my main problem was that whenever I would start work I'd get distracted by some new framework or something that was more interesting that what I was currently using. I also redesigned everything about 10 times, this happens to me a lot when there is no deadline in-site, take a look at the ones that didn't make the cut:

After all the back and fourth I realised I needed a site that would encourage me to actually write, instead of it looking cool and me never updating it, which is how all my other endeavours have gone.

Here are some things that I've discovered while working on this site:

**I'm not a fan of templates** - I'd much rather a clunky half working site that I've designed than wrestle with a template that will never quite feel right.

**I like static** - I quite like writing this in a text file and then committing it, I think anything that requires me to login and use an online editor would be another thing stopping me from actually writing anything.

**Stick with what I know (sort of)** - I ended up using React with an Express back-end that reads Markdown files, could have been simpler, but also could have been way more complicated and you wouldn't be reading this, as I would still be changing frameworks every two weeks. After getting it all working, I realised that I couldn't host it anywhere for free without it taking 30 seconds to spin up, so I rewrote the whole Markdown thing for the front-end.

This is my current setup:

- Typescript
- React
- React router
- Emotion
- Chakra (the styled system part not the components)
- Badly written front-matter parser ðŸ« 
- ~~Node.js~~
- ~~Express~~
- Hosted for free on Netlify

So happy it's online!
