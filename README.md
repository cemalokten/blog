# Blog

This is my personal blog hosted at [cem.al](https://cem.al). It serves as a platform for showcasing my recent coding projects and writing blog posts about things that interest me or I have learned. The main purpose of this blog is to help me teach myself new skills and concepts. The blog is built using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

## Features

- Coding projects showcase
- Blog posts on various topics
- Theme: Heavily modified version of [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog)

## Installation and Setup

To set up the blog locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cemalokten/blog
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd blog
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. To run the blog locally, use the following command:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --watch --serve
```

This will start a local development server, and you can view the blog by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
