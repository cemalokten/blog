# Blog

This is my personal blog hosted at [cem.al](https://cem.al). 

I use it for showcasing my recent coding projects and writing blog posts about things that interest me or I have learned. The main purpose of this blog is to help me learn new skills and concepts. 

The blog is built using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.
